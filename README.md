# belnap-tools

This is a web app for experimenting with Belnap logic.

## Development

Run the Rescript watcher to generate JavaScript output from the Rescript files:

```sh
yarn res:dev
```

In another terminal, run the Next.JS watcher to serve the generated JavaScript to `localhost:3000`:

```sh
yarn dev
```
